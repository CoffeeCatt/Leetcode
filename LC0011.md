# Container With Most Water
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
```
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
```
## Code
```
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        most_water=0
        start=0
        end=len(height)-1
        while start<end:
            curr_water=(end-start)*min(height[end],height[start])
            most_water=max(most_water,curr_water)
            if height[end]<height[start]:
                end-=1
            else:
                start+=1
        return most_water
```
## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of height.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
