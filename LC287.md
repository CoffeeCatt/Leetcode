# Find the Duplicate Number
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/
```
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.
```

## Code
```
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow=nums[0]
        fast=nums[0]
        while True:
            slow=nums[slow]
            fast=nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow==fast:
                break
        slow2=nums[0]
        while slow!=slow2:
            slow=nums[slow]
            slow2=nums[slow2]
        return slow
```

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), n is the length of nums.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
