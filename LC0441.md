# Arranging Coins
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/
```
You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins.
The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
```
## Code
```
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        # arr=[1,1+2,1+2+3,..,1+..+k,...]
        # n
        left=0
        right=n
        while left<=right:
            k=left+(right-left)//2
            curr=k*(k+1)//2
            if curr==n:
                return k
            elif curr<n:
                left=k+1
            else:
                right=k-1
        return right
```
## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1).
