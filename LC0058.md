# Length of Last Word
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/
```
Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. 
If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
```
## Code
### Python Built-in split
```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        words=s.split()
        if not words:
            return 0
        else:
            return len(words[-1])
```
### By scratch
```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        p=len(s)
        length=0
        while p>0:
            p-=1
            if s[p]!=" ":
                length+=1
            elif length>0:
                return length
        return length
```
## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of string.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
