# Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/
```
You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. 
Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.
```
## Code
```
class Solution:
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time: List[int]) -> int:
        remainders=collections.defaultdict(int)
        ret=0
        for t in time:
            if t%60==0:
                ret+=remainders[0]
            else:
                ret+=remainders[60-t%60]
            remainders[t%60]+=1
        return ret
```
## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of list.
- Space Complexity: O(1),because the size of the array remainders is fixed with 60.
