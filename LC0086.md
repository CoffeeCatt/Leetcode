# Partition List
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/
```
Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
```
## Code
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        before=before_head=ListNode(0)
        after=after_head=ListNode(0)
        while head:
            if head.val<x:
                before.next=head
                before=before.next
            else:
                after.next=head
                after=after.next
            head=head.next
        after.next=None
        before.next=after_head.next
        return before_head.next
```
## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
