# Add Two Numbers
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
```
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, 
and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
```

## Code
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        carry=0
        dummy=ListNode(0)
        head=dummy
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            x1=l1.val if l1 else 0
            x2=l2.val if l2 else 0
            carry,curr=divmod(x1+x2+carry,10)
            head.next=ListNode(curr)
            head=head.next
            l1=l1.next if l1 else None
            l2=l2.next if l2 else None
        return dummy.next
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity : O(max(m, n)). Assume that m and n represents the length of l1 and l2 respectively.

- Space complexity : O(max(m, n)). The length of the new list is at most max(m,n)+1.
