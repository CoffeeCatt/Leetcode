# Valid Sudoku
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/
```
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

                                if board[start][end] in box_set:

            return True
        return validRow() and validCol() and validBox()

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the board length.
- Space Complexity: O(n^2).
