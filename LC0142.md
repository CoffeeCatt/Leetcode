# Linked List Cycle II
## Problem 
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
```
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Notice that you should not modify the linked list.

## Code
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, head):
        if not head:
            return None
        slow=head
        fast=head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next.next
            if slow==fast:
                return slow
        return None
    
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        fast=head
        slow=self.intersection(head)
        if slow is None:
            return None
        while fast!=slow:
            fast=fast.next
            slow=slow.next
        return slow
```

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), n is the number of the nodes.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
