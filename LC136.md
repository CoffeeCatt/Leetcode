# Single Number
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/
```
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
```
## Code
```
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res=0
        for num in nums:
            res=res^num
        return res
```
## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), n is the length of nums.
- Space Complexity: O(1).
