# Climbing Stairs
## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
```
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
```
## Code
```
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)
        if n==1:
            return 1
        if n==0:
            return 1
        i=1
        curr=1
        prev=1
        while i<n:
            res=curr+prev
            prev=curr
            curr=res
            i+=1
        return curr
```
## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n).
- Space Complexity: O(1).
